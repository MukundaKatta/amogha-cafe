# Self-Service Kiosk

**URL:** https://amoghahotels.com/kiosk/
**File:** `kiosk/index.html` (~2,400 lines)

A premium self-service ordering kiosk designed for tablets and touchscreens placed at the restaurant counter or tables. Customers browse the menu, customize items with spice levels and add-ons, and pay — all without staff assistance.

---

## Multi-Tenant / Multi-Shop

The kiosk supports multiple independent shops on a single deployment. Each shop has its own menu, branding, categories, and admin PIN.

**URL routing:**
```
/kiosk/              → Amogha Cafe & Restaurant (default)
/kiosk/?shop=teashop → Tea Shop (separate menu + branding)
```

**How it works:**
1. `shopId` is read from the `?shop=` URL query param (defaults to `amogha`)
2. Shop config is loaded from the Firestore `shops` collection
3. All Firestore queries (menu, orders) are filtered by `shopId`
4. Shop name, logo, tagline, and theme are applied dynamically

**Shop config document (`shops/{shopId}`):**
```json
{
  "name": "Tea Shop",
  "tagline": "Fresh Teas & Snacks",
  "adminPin": "teapin",
  "categories": ["Teas & Chai", "Snacks", "Cigarettes"],
  "theme": { "gold": "#c8902a", "bg": "#050302" },
  "logo": "https://..."
}
```

**Adding a new shop:** Go to Admin → Shops tab → "Create Shop" form.

## Ordering Flow

### Step 1 — Spice Level
When "ADD" is tapped, a bottom sheet appears with 4 options:
- 😊 None
- 🌶 Mild
- 🌶🌶 Medium (default)
- 🌶🌶🌶 Hot

A "Skip (Medium)" button uses the default.

### Step 2 — Add-Ons
After selecting spice, an add-on picker sheet slides up:
- Checkboxes with name, category, and price per add-on
- Running total shown in header badge
- "Add to Cart" button with final price
- Add-ons are fetched from Firestore `addons` collection (cached in localStorage, 10-min TTL)

### Step 3 — Added to Cart
Item is added with the structure:
```
{ name, price, qty, spice: "medium", addons: [{name, price}], addonTotal: 35 }
```
Same item with different spice/addon combinations = separate cart entries.

### Combo Pairings
After adding certain items, a "Perfect Pairings" bar appears with quick-add chips:

| Item Added | Suggested |
|------------|-----------|
| Chicken Dum Biryani | Raita, Mirchi ka Salan, Buttermilk |
| Butter Chicken | Butter Naan, Garlic Naan, Laccha Paratha |
| Veg Manchurian | Veg Hakka Noodles, Veg Fried Rice |
| *(17 total pairings)* | |

## Visual Design

### Glassmorphism
- All overlays use `backdrop-filter: blur(20-30px)` with semi-transparent backgrounds
- Inset white edge highlights for depth

### Ambient Effects
- 6 floating gold particles (blurred circles, 20s animation cycle)
- Grain texture overlay (SVG fractal noise, subtle)
- Gold radial gradient aura at top-left and bottom-right

### Color Palette
```
Gold: #D4A017 (primary), #F5D76E (light), #B8860B (dark)
Text: #ede2d2 (primary), #a09080 (dim), #6a5a4a (faint)
Background: #080604 (dark mode), #f5f0e8 (light mode)
Cards: rgba(18,15,12,0.82) (dark), rgba(255,252,248,0.92) (light)
```

### Custom Easing
```css
--ease: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)         /* Material Design */
--ease-out: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)    /* Quick decelerate */
--ease-luxe: cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)  /* Smooth overshoot */
--ease-spring: cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1) /* Bouncy */
```

---

## Light / Dark Mode

- Toggle in header (persists to localStorage)
- **Light mode is the default** — warm bamboo-texture background (`#c4b88a`) with vertical reed-stripe CSS gradient
- Dark mode: deep black/brown backgrounds, gold accents, cream text
- Shop-specific dark background colour stored in `document.documentElement.dataset.darkBg` and applied only when toggling to dark

---

## Accessibility

- **Large Font Mode:** Toggle (Aa button) scales fonts up 20%, increases touch targets. Persists to localStorage.
- Semantic HTML elements (`<button>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<header>`)
- `aria-hidden` on decorative particles
- Minimum 42-48px touch targets
- XSS protection via `escHtml()` on all dynamic content

---

## Three-Language Support

| Language | Code | Voice Recognition |
|----------|------|-------------------|
| English | en | en-IN |
| Telugu | te | te-IN |
| Hindi | hi | hi-IN |

All UI labels, buttons, placeholders, and category names switch. Menu item names remain in their original language.

---

## PWA

- Service worker (`kiosk/sw.js`) — network-first for HTML/JS, cache-first for images

- Web App Manifest (`kiosk/manifest.json`):

  - Orientation: portrait
  - Theme: gold (#D4A017)

## Intended Setup

- Dedicated tablet (10"+ recommended) mounted at counter or table
