## Loyalty Program

### Earning Points

| Action | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Place an order | 1 point per ₹10 spent |
| Write a review | 25 points (1 per order cap) |
| Share an order (Social Sharing) | 10 points |

- Points are awarded automatically after each qualifying action
- Points are stored in Firestore `users` collection under the customer's phone

### Loyalty Tiers

| Tier | Minimum Points | Icon | Color |
|------|---------------|------|-------|
| Bronze | 0 | 🥉 | Copper |
| Silver | 500 | 🥈 | Silver |
| Gold | 1,000 | 🥇 | Gold |

Tier is calculated live from current point balance — it updates automatically as points accumulate.

### Displaying Points

When a customer is signed in, the **Loyalty Widget** appears in the top navigation bar:
- Shows tier icon + current point balance
- Clicking it opens the **Loyalty Modal**

### Loyalty Modal

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Current tier & icon | Bronze / Silver / Gold with visual badge |
| Point balance | e.g. "650 points" |
| Progress bar | Shows progress to next tier |
| Points to next tier | e.g. "350 points to Gold" |
| Points history | Recent earn events (order ID, points, date) |
| Redemption info | How to use points (future feature placeholder) |

## Referral Program

### How It Works

1. A signed-in customer generates their unique referral link from their profile / loyalty modal
2. They share the link with friends
3. When a new customer signs up using the referral link, **both** get a credit:
   - **Referrer:** Loyalty points bonus
   - **New customer:** Discount on first order (or points bonus)

### Referral Data

Stored in Firestore `referrals` collection:

```json
{
  "referrerId": "uid of the person who shared",
  "referredId": "uid of the new signup",
  "createdAt": "timestamp",
  "credited": true
}
```

### Referral Link Format

```
https://amoghahotels.com/?ref=USER_UID
```

When the new user signs up, the `ref` parameter is read from the URL and the referral is recorded.

## Birthday Rewards

**File:** `src/modules/loyalty.js`

### Client-Side Birthday Banner
- On login, if the user has a `dob` field in their profile and the current month matches their birth month:
  - A gold gradient birthday banner appears at the top of the page
  - Auto-dismisses or can be closed manually
- Triggered by `checkBirthdayRewards(user)` called after sign-in

### Server-Side Birthday Coupon (Cloud Function)
- A scheduled Cloud Function (`birthdayRewards`) runs daily at 8 AM IST
- Queries all users whose `dob` matches today's MM-DD
- Auto-creates a coupon `BDAY-{phone}` with:
  - 30% discount
  - 1 use max
  - ₹200 minimum order
  - Valid for 7 days
- See [16-cloud-functions.md](16-cloud-functions.md) for details

## Gamification Badges

**File:** `src/modules/badges.js`

10 achievement badges that customers earn through various actions.

### Badge Definitions

| Badge | Requirement | Icon |
|-------|-------------|------|
| First Bite | Place first order | 🍽️ |
| Regular | Place 5 orders | ⭐ |
| Foodie | Place 10 orders | 🍕 |
| Super Fan | Place 25 orders | 👑 |
| Explorer | Order from all menu categories | 🗺️ |
| Streak Master | Order 3 days in a row | 🔥 |
| Big Spender | Single order over ₹1,000 | 💰 |
| Critic | Write 5 reviews | ✍️ |
| Night Owl | Place an order after 10 PM | 🦉 |
| Early Bird | Place an order before 9 AM | 🐦 |

### How It Works

1. After each order, `checkAndAwardBadges(user, order)` is called
2. Each badge definition has a check function that evaluates the user's history
3. Newly earned badges trigger:
   - Toast notification with badge icon and name
   - Confetti animation
   - Badge saved to user's Firestore document: `badges: [{badgeId, earnedAt}]`

### Badge Gallery

- Accessible from a badge icon in the navigation bar
- Modal shows all 10 badges in a grid
- Earned badges shown in full color with earned date
- Locked badges shown in grayscale with requirement description
- `openBadgeGallery()` / `closeBadgeGallery()` functions
